# PDF to XML Tagging

Welcome to the PDF to XML Tagging repository! This repository houses tools and resources for converting PDF documents into XML format, specifically tailored to adhere to the GOST R ontology.

## Contents:

- **GUIpdf2XML.py:** This is the graphical user interface (GUI) program designed for converting PDFs to XML according to the GOST R ontology. With an intuitive interface, users can easily convert their PDF documents into structured XML files.

- **XML Tagging.ipynb:** This notebook provides insights into the development process of the XML tagging code. It offers a comprehensive overview of the tagging process, including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and semantic analysis.

- **XML promo.ipynb:** Here, you'll find the final version of the tagging code without the GUI. It includes batch processing capabilities for efficient XML conversion.

## Key Features:

- **User-Friendly Interface:** GUIpdf2XML.py offers a seamless experience for users, allowing them to convert PDFs to XML with just a few clicks.

- **Ontology Compliance:** The XML output adheres to the GOST R ontology, ensuring compatibility and consistency in document structure.

- **Batch Processing:** XML promo.ipynb enables batch processing of multiple PDF documents, streamlining the conversion process for efficiency.

## Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies as outlined in the README file.
3. Run GUIpdf2XML.py to launch the graphical interface and start converting your PDFs to XML.

## Contributions:

We welcome contributions from the community to enhance and expand the functionality of this tool. Whether it's improving the GUI, optimizing the tagging algorithm, or adding support for additional ontologies, your contributions are valuable in advancing this project.

Thank you for your interest in PDF to XML Tagging. We hope this tool proves to be a valuable asset in your document processing endeavors!
